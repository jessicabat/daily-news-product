The series is full of history — the new Resident Evil Requiem is technically the ninth mainline game, but there are a bunch of spinoffs, remakes, movies, and even a TV show — which can make it fun to follow for fans. But it’s also intimidating for people like me who haven’t played everything. The latest release, Resident Evil Requiem, tries to appeal to both sides by starring a new character, the cowering FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, and a series favorite, action hero Leon Kennedy.\n\nInitially, it really works: the first half of Resident Evil Requiem is one of the freshest horror games I’ve ever played. But as the game goes on, it gets bogged down by Resident Evil’s past.\n\n**Spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem are below.**\n\nGrace Ashcroft, the game’s other protagonist. Image: Capcom\n\nFor much of the first half of Requiem, the balance between the two is close to perfect. Most of the time, you’re playing as Grace, and her limited arsenal means you have to be thoughtful about every step and bullet. I was constantly on edge as I crept through the hallways of a medical care facility, narrowly creeping past horrors like a monster known only as “the girl” and a huge zombie wielding a butcher knife. And despite some connections to past games, Grace’s story stands on its own, meaning I wasn’t worried about lore I had missed while I was also trying to survive.\n\nWhen the game would switch to brief sections in Leon’s perspective, I could take out enemies that I felt powerless against as Grace with relative ease. Leon is more capable in battle than the inexperienced Grace — he’s been through the Resident Evil wringer a few times already — and I felt an immense sense of relief when I was able to kill that butcher knife zombie in a few blasts from my shotgun. But soon enough, I’d be back in Grace’s shoes, experiencing pure terror again and counting the seconds until the game would let me play as Leon for a break from the tension.\n\nThe game goes back an"

        "text": "Google on Friday unveiled its plan for its Chrome browser to secure HTTPS certificates against quantum computer attacks without breaking the Internet.\n\nThe objective is a tall order. The quantum-resistant cryptographic data needed to transparently publish TLS certificates is roughly 40 times bigger than the classical cryptographic material used today. A typical X.509 certificate chain used today comprises six elliptic curve signatures and two EC public keys, each of them only 64 bytes. This material can be cracked through the quantum-enabled Shor’s algorithm. The full chain is roughly 4 kilobytes. All this data must be transmitted when a browser connects to a site.\n\nThe bigger they come, the slower they move\n\n“The bigger you make the certificate, the slower the handshake and the more people you leave behind,” said Bas Westerbaan, principal research engineer at Cloudflare, which is partnering with Google on the transition. “Our problem is we don’t want to leave people behind in this transition.” Speaking to Ars, he said that people will likely disable the new encryption if it slows their browsing. He added that the massive size increase can also degrade “middle boxes,” which sit between browsers and the final site.\n\nTo bypass the bottleneck, companies are turning to Merkle Trees, a data structure that uses cryptographic hashes and other math to verify the contents of large amounts of information using a small fraction of material used in more traditional verification processes in public key infrastructure. Cloudflare has a much deeper dive into Merkle Trees here.\n\nMerkle Tree Certificates, “replace the heavy, serialized chain of signatures found in traditional PKI with compact Merkle Tree proofs,” members of Google’s Chrome Secure Web and Networking Team wrote Friday. “In this model, a Certification Authority (CA) signs a single ‘Tree Head’ representing potentially millions of certificates, and the ‘certificate’ sent to the browser is merely a lightweight proof of in"

When Recteq came calling with a similar offer to check out the Flagship 1600, I figured it would be a good way to stay warm all winter.\n\nWhile the two smokers have a lot in common, the Recteq definitely feels like an upgrade from the Traeger I’ve been using. Not only does it have nearly twice the cooking space, but the huge pellet hopper, rounded barrel, and proper smokestack help me feel like a real pitmaster.\n\nThe trade-off is losing some of the usability features that make the Woodridge Pro a great first smoker. The setup isn’t as quite as simple, and the larger footprint and less ergonomic conditions require a little more experience or patience. With both options, excellent smoked meat is just a few button presses away, but speaking as someone with both in their backyard, I’ve been firing up the Recteq more often.\n\nGetting Settled\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nSetting up the Recteq wasn’t as time-consuming as the Woodridge, but it was more difficult to manage on my own. Some of the steps, like attaching the bull horns to the lid, or flipping the barrel onto its stand, would really benefit from a patient friend or loved one. Like most smokers, you’ll need to run a burn-in cycle at 400 degrees Fahrenheit to make sure there’s nothing left over from manufacturing or shipping. Given the amount of setup time and need to cool down the smoker after, I would recommend setting this up Friday afternoon if you want to smoke on a Saturday."

And it’s not just about the numbers.\n\nIf that’s not enough motivation for you, the numbers support the importance of having a retirement plan. Research from T. Rowe Price found that individuals with a plan had two to four times more wealth when entering retirement compared to those without one (3).\n\nThat’s because a little over half (51%) of retirees who were surveyed by Clever Real Estate said they themselves had no plan if their retirement savings were to run out — and 43% said they even preferred death to financial ruin.\n\nBefore getting started, it’s important to note that their doom and gloom doesn’t come from nowhere. It comes from experience.\n\nHere’s why it’s so important to have a retirement plan — and tips for how you can start making one today.\n\nThat level of agreement is rare in the world of surveys. But are they right to think future retirees are underprepared?\n\nA dramatic shift like that suggests retirees in America are clearly worried about the prospects of future retirees. In fact, 92% of retirees in the study said the average person underestimates how much money is required to retire securely.\n\nThat’s a change of opinion to the tune of $243,490 — in just a year.\n\nFor some perspective, in 2024, Clever Real Estate conducted the same study, but respondents thought they would need only $580,310 (2).\n\nMost Americans earn a dismal 0.39% APY on their cash at big banks.

The foreign minister, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, said in a post on X on Thursday: “We were informed that 272 Ghanaians are believed to have been lured into battle since 2022 for which an estimated 55 have been killed and 2 captured as prisoners of war.”\n\nAt a media briefing on Tuesday, Andrii Sybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, who was standing alongside Ablakwa, said more than 1,780 Africans from 36 different countries were fighting in the Russian army.\n\nGhana, which has economic and diplomatic ties to Russia, intended to raise awareness about recruitment and to dismantle “dark web illegal recruitment schemes operating within our jurisdiction”, Ablakwa said in his post on X. “This is not our war and we cannot allow our youth to become human shields for others,” he said.\n\nThe minister said Ghana’s government would intensify public education and work to “track and dismantle all dark web illegal recruitment schemes” operating in the country. He added that the two captured Ghanaians had warned young people against being tempted by financial incentives to join the conflict.\n\nSouth Africa’s government said this week that two of its citizens had died on the frontlines of the conflict.

Discovery, Laura Loomer celebrated on X in all-caps: “VICTORY.” The far-right influencer, who has called herself President Donald Trump’s “loyalty enforcer,” had spent months denouncing Netflix over its ties to former president Barack Obama and urging Trump to “kill” the megamerger that would have given the streaming giant control over CNN, HBO and more. Netflix’s withdrawal Thursday evening cleared the way for David Ellison’s Paramount Skydance to instead take the reins of the cable network, whose coverage the president has labeled “fake news.”\n\nParamount’s triumph in a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery is a game-changing business move — one that will add HBO, the DC Comics universe, the Harry Potter and Star Trek franchises, and a slew of other TV channels and movie studios to a vast father-and-son empire that already includes Oracle, Paramount Pictures, CBS News and a chunk of the new American TikTok. In an email sent to staff on Friday, and obtained by The Washington Post, Ellison said the “historic” merger would create “the next-generation global media and entertainment company.”\n\nAmong power players in politics and media, Paramount’s swoop is also widely viewed as a win for the right amid a broader push to rein in what many conservatives view as a liberal slant in the media and entertainment industries. And in Washington, questions have swirled as to what role was played by a president who famously relishes dealmaking.\n\nAs recently as Thursday morning, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos appeared at the White House amid reports that he would meet with Trump personally as he sought to save a deal the Silicon Valley streaming giant first struck with Warner Bros. in December.

That's down more than 29% from $14.56 billion in the year-earlier period.\n\nThis was the final quarter under Warren Buffett as CEO, who announced he was stepping down at the annual shareholders meeting last May. Greg Abel took the reins to start 2026 and vowed in Berkshire's annual letter accompanying Saturday's results to continue the culture Buffett built of financial strength and capital discipline. Buffett remains chairman.\n\nInsurance underwriting profits dropped 54% to $1.56 billion from $3.41 billion a year prior. Insurance investment income slid nearly 25% from to $3.1 billion from $4.088 billion.\n\nFor the full-year 2025, operating earnings totaled $44.49 billion. That's down from $47.44 billion in the year prior.\n\nProfits from insurance underwriting came in at $7.26 billion, down from $9 billion in 2024. Insurance investment income for the year eased to $12.5 billion from $13.6 billion a year prior.\n\nOverall earnings, which include gains or losses from the conglomerate's stock market investments, fell slightly in the fourth quarter to $19.2 billion from $19.7 billion a year prior. However, those numbers were impacted by a $4.5 billion impairment from Berkshire's investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental Petroleum. Investment gains came in at $13.5 billion.\n\nFull year overall earnings, meanwhile, fell to $66.97 billion from $89 billion a year prior. To be sure, Berkshire always tells investors to pay little attention to its investments' performance over short time frames.\n\n\"The amount of investment gains (losses) in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extr"

The US and Israel have begun joint \"major combat operations\" in Iran, causing a plunge in Bitcoin's price, but it has mostly recovered. Anthropic's CEO has slammed the Pentagon's decision to halt use of the company's systems, despite this, the US military used Anthropic in a strike on Iran. The OCC has proposed rules that could impact stablecoin rewards programs, potentially affecting Coinbase's USDC rewards arrangement.\n\n## Market & Business Implications\n* Tokenized gold assets such as PAX Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUt) become the only continuously available trading venues when CME gold futures are closed, according to Iggy Ioppe, as stated in Article 1.\n* The price of Bitcoin fell from $65,572 to $63,176 in about an hour after the US and Israel began joint \"major combat operations\" in Iran, but has mostly recovered, as reported in Article 2.\n* The OCC's proposed rules under the GENIUS Act could restrict certain stablecoin rewards programs, potentially affecting Coinbase's USDC rewards arrangement with Circle, as mentioned in Article 4.\n* The tokenized gold market cap has jumped to $4.4 billion, with a 177% increase in market capitalization over the past year, as stated in Article 3.\n* The US military used Anthropic's Claude AI model for operational support in a strike on Iran, despite the Trump administration's order to halt use of the company's systems, as reported in Article 5.\n\n## Beginner-Friendly Summary\nSomething big is happening with gold prices on weekends. When regular gold markets are closed, special online markets called \"tokenized gold\" take over and decide the price of gold. There was a big fight between the US and Iran, and this made the price of a popular cryptocurrency called Bitcoin go down, but then it went back up. A company called Anthropic is upset with the US government about how its technology is being used. The government is also making new rules about special kinds of cryptocurrencies called \"stablecoins\".",

The prohibitions appear to outlaw certain arrangements between stablecoin issuers and third parties in which the third parties pass yield onto stablecoin holders in connection with their “holding, use, or retention” of the tokens.\n\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:0px;overflow:hidden;line-height:0\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span>\n\nThat sounds not so far from the current arrangement between USDC issuer Circle and Coinbase.
