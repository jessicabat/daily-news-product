        "text": "A group of 23 Democratic US senators sent a letter Friday to the top federal regulator overseeing prediction markets, urging the agency to avoid weighing in on pending court cases over the legality of offerings on the platforms tied to “sports, war, and other prohibited events.”\n\nPrediction markets, which sell contracts tied to the outcome of real-world developments, have exploded in popularity over the past year, attracting an increasingly mainstream fanbase eager to wager on everything from geopolitical conflicts to fashion choices to the Super Bowl. As they expanded, the platforms have become a magnet for ethical and legal controversies. On Thursday, for example, Israeli authorities announced that two people had been arrested on suspicion of using classified military information to place bets on Polymarket, one of the biggest players in the industry.\n\nThe letter from the senators reflects a growing divide over how Polymarket and competitors like Kalshi should be handled. The US government currently considers prediction markets to be derivative markets, which means they fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But state authorities, who have emerged as some of the industry’s staunchest critics, are arguing the platforms should be subject to the same local regulations as gambling products.\n\nThere are at least 19 ongoing federal lawsuits challenging Kalshi’s legality, according to an analysis by National Public Radio. In one case in Massachusetts, a judge banned the company from offering sports contracts after the state sued it for operating without a gambling license. Polymarket then filed a counter lawsuit against Massachusetts arguing that state regulators don’t have authority over its business.\n\nIn his first public remarks about prediction markets since taking office in December, CFTC chairman Michael Selig suggested that the agency might wade into the battles, noting that it has the “expertise and responsibility to defend its exc"

Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images\n\nInflation decelerated in January as price pressures eased across a range of consumer staples such as food and gasoline, though they remain elevated for certain categories, including electricity and home heating, economists said. The consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 2.4% in January from 12 months earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday. That was down from 2.7% in December and lower than expected. Inflation is still running above the target of policymakers at the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, which aims for an inflation level around 2%, economists said.\n\nEffect of tariffs and immigration policy\n\nInflation would likely be at the Fed's target absent Trump administration policies on tariffs and immigration, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. Tariffs levied by President Donald Trump on a host of trading partners have put upward pressure on prices, as many businesses pass at least some of those import taxes on to U.S. consumers, economists said. Immigration policy has also put some upward pressure on prices for services by reducing labor supply, they said.\n\n\"Broadly speaking, inflation is still too high for most Americans and the Fed,\" Zandi said. \"But I think we've seen the worst of it. If there are no changes in policy — to tariffs and immigration policy — we should get inflation back to something more comfortable by this time next year.\" The Yale University Budget Lab estimated in January that the U.S.' effective tariff rate had risen to 16.9%, the highest since 1932. The Supreme Court is poised to rule on the constitutionality of a large swath of Trump's tariffs in the coming weeks.\n\n'Big caveat' in CPI report\n\nThe slowdown in inflation was \"relatively broad-based\" in January, aside from \"some pockets of acceleration in services (particularly transportation costs),\" Jason Pride, chief of in"

Since then, more than 2,700 people have been arrested at protests for holding signs saying \"I support Palestine Action.\" Almost 700 have been charged under the Terrorism Act, although no one has yet been convicted.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nSupporters of Palestine Action and civil liberties groups say the arrests for peaceful protest ride roughshod over free speech and the right to protest.\n\nPalestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori said the decision \"is a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people, striking down a decision that will forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history.\"\n\nYasmine Ahmed, U.K. director of Human Rights Watch, called the court ruling \"a shot in the arm for British democracy.\" She said the Brit"

And the U.S. has tolerated Israeli settler violence and Israeli government measures that undermine prospects for Palestinian statehood.\n\nEven under the Biden administration, efforts to prepare a new Palestinian security force to replace Hamas in postwar Gaza ran into problems.\n\nWhile the Gaza war raged on, U.S. security officials expanded an initiative to train hundreds of Palestinian Authority Security Forces in advanced law enforcement techniques, including SWAT training, according to three former U.S. military and law enforcement officers involved in the effort.\n\nBut those efforts were eventually hamstrung by concerns from both Israel and the U.S. that security training given to Palestinians could be turned against Israel, according to the "

    "summary": "## Executive Summary\nThe US job market saw a surprisingly positive increase in January, with 131,000 new jobs added. Meanwhile, the rise of artificial intelligence is expected to disrupt credit markets, potentially leading to tens of billions of dollars in corporate loan defaults. Companies like DHL and UPS are automating their warehouses to increase efficiency, and Rivian has announced plans to increase vehicle production despite expecting significant losses. Spirit Airlines is selling planes and recalling furloughed staff in an effort to stabilize its operations.\n\n## Market & Business Implications\n* The AI disruption is likely to impact credit markets, with potential defaults of $75-120 billion by the end of the year, affecting companies with high levels of debt, particularly in the software and data services sectors.\n* Automation and logistics companies are investing heavily in warehouse automation, using technologies like autonomous robots to increase efficiency and reduce labor costs.\n* The electric vehicle market is expected to see significant growth, with Rivian targeting a 47-59% increase in vehicle deliveries, despite anticipating substantial losses.\n* Airlines like Spirit are taking steps to stabilize their operations, including selling off assets and adjusting staffing levels, in response to financial struggles.\n* Companies must adapt to the rapid pace of technological change, including the rise of AI, to remain competitive and mitigate potential risks.\n\n## Beginner-Friendly Summary\nThere are some big changes happening in the business world. The US added more jobs than expected in January, which is good news. But some companies are worried about how artificial intelligence will affect their businesses. Some companies, like those that deliver packages, are using robots to make their work easier and faster. A company that makes electric cars, called Rivian, wants to make more cars, but it might lose money. An airline called Spirit is trying to get back on its feet by selling some of its planes and calling back some of its employees. Overall, companies are trying to adapt to big changes in technology and the economy.",

Software firms were hit first and hardest, but a rolling series of sell-offs hit sectors as disparate as finance, real estate and trucking.\n\nIn his note, Mish and other UBS analysts lay out a baseline scenario in which borrowers of leveraged loans and private credit see a combined $75 billion to $120 billion in fresh defaults by the end of this year.\n\nCNBC calculated those figures by using Mish's estimates for increases of up to 2.5% and up to 4% in defaults for leveraged loans and private credit, respectively, by late 2026.

Now, their distance and efforts are greatly reduced by autonomous mobile robots that can unload containers for the package delivery and supply chain management company with a speed of up to 650 cases per hour. \"That is what we look forward to, and where we've been successful in deploying technology at scale over the last five years, going from when we started in 2020 with 240 projects, and now we're up to 10,000 projects,\" Tim Tetzlaff, DHL's global head of digital transformation, told CNBC. The company's autonomous innovations have accelerated processes at 95% of DHL's global warehouses. Item-picking robots in one warehouse have increased units picked per hour by 30%, while autonomous forklifts at that same warehouse have contributed a 20% increase in efficiency, the company said. Tetzlaff said automation is important for the company because it's such a labor-intensive business. \"We still have the ambition to grow our business even further, but if you look at where these distribution centers should be located … it's typically very tough to find additional labor or even additional spaces just to build these warehouses there,\" he said. DHL is one of multiple fulfillment companies moving toward automation and leveraging artificial intelligence as the industry works toward greater efficiency.

The identity of Bitcoin as a digital gold or tech stock is also being questioned, with its price increasingly correlated with risk assets. \n\n## Market & Business Implications\n* The potential recovery of Bitcoin and other altcoins may attract new investors, but the market remains volatile and subject to regulatory risks.\n* The proposed CLARITY Act in the US could provide regulatory clarity and stability, but its passage is uncertain and may be delayed.\n* The 36% capital gains tax in the Netherlands may drive investors away from the country and into more tax-friendly jurisdictions.\n* The correlation between Bitcoin's price and risk assets, such as software stocks, may indicate a shift in its identity from a digital gold to a tech stock.\n* Institutional participation in the crypto market is growing, with companies like Grayscale and BlackRock expanding their crypto offerings.\n\n## Beginner-Friendly Summary\nThe crypto market is trying to get better, but it's still very unpredictable. The price of Bitcoin might go up, but it could also go down. Some new rules and laws might affect how people invest in crypto. For example, a new law in the Netherlands might make it expensive for people to invest in crypto. Meanwhile, people are wondering if Bitcoin is more like a safe investment or a risky tech stock. This means that investors are trying to figure out what Bitcoin is and how it will behave in the future.",

        "text": "Key points:\n\nBitcoin is attempting a comeback, which is expected to face stiff resistance at the breakdown level of $74,508.\n\nSeveral major altcoins are attempting a recovery, signaling that lower levels are attracting buyers.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has risen above $68,500, as buyers attempt to form a higher low near $65,000. According to Glassnode, BTC is stuck between the true market mean at $79,200 and the realized price near $55,000. The on-chain data provider expects the range-bound action to continue until a major catalyst either pushes the price above or below the range.\n\nStandard Chartered also had a muted forecast for BTC. It lowered BTC’s target to $100,000 from $150,000 for 2026. The bank expects BTC to fall to $50,000 over the next few months, followed by a recovery for the remainder of the year.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: TradingView\n\nSeveral analysts also believe that BTC has not yet bottomed out. Crypto analyst Tony Research said in a post on X that BTC will bottom in the $40,000 to $50,000 zone, possibly “between mid-September and late November 2026.”\n\nCould BTC and the major altcoins start a recovery? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.\n\nBitcoin price prediction\n\nBTC turned up from $65,118 on Thursday, indicating demand at lower levels. The bulls will try to push the price to the breakdown level of $74,508.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView\n\nIf the Bitcoin price turns down sharply from the $74,508 level, it suggests that the bears remain active at higher levels. That may keep the BTC/USDT pair between $74,508 and $60,000 for a few days. On the downside, a break below the $60,000 support may sink the pair to $52,500.\n\nAlternatively, if buyers thrust the price above $74,508, it suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair may then rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($85,046).\n\nEther price prediction\n\nBuyers are attempting to push and maintain Ether (ETH) above the $2,000 l"

Elsewhere, crypto executives have flooded the ranks of a new US CFTC advisory panel.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary believes CLARITY Act could revive investor sentiment\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the timely passage of the CLARITY Act could help stabilize markets and improve investor sentiment amid ongoing volatility.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Bessent argued that regulatory certainty could ease the current market downturn.\n\n“In a time when we are having one of these historically volatile sell-offs, I think some clarity on the CLARITY bill would give great comfort to the market, and we could move forward from there,” Bessent said.\n\nHe continued: “I think if the Democrats were to take the House, which is far from my best case, then the prospects of getting a deal done will just fall apart.”\n\nThe CLARITY Act is proposed legislation to establish a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. Broadly, it seeks to define which crypto assets fall under securities law versus commodities law, clarify oversight responsibilities between regulators and provide more predictable compliance standards for investors.\n\nHe added that timing is critical. Bessent is pushing for passage by June, warning that delays, especially ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, could complicate negotiations.\n\nBessent appeared on CNBC on Friday to discuss the crypto market structure bill.

        "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) was once pitched as digital gold — a hedge against monetary instability and market turmoil. But recent price action tells a different story.\n\nAs institutional participation has grown, particularly through exchange-traded funds and other traditional vehicles, Bitcoin has increasingly traded in lockstep with risk assets. The latest downturn in software stocks, fueled by renewed uncertainty around AI’s impact on the sector, has been mirrored in crypto markets, raising fresh questions about Bitcoin’s evolving identity.\n\nThat changing dynamic sets the tone for this week’s Crypto Biz. New research from Grayscale examines Bitcoin’s growing correlation with growth equities, while one Ether (ETH) treasury company is doubling down despite multibillion-dollar paper losses. Elsewhere, BlackRock is expanding its tokenization push through a Uniswap integration, and Polymarket is taking its fight over state regulation to federal court.\n\nGrayscale: Bitcoin is trading like a growth asset, not digital gold\n\nNew research from Grayscale suggests that Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative has recently taken a back seat, with the digital asset behaving more like a growth stock.\n\nIn the report, author Zach Pandl said that while Grayscale continues to view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value due to its fixed supply and independence from central banks, its short-term trading patterns resemble those of high-growth equities.\n\nThe analysis found a strong correlation between Bitcoin and software stocks over the past two years. That relationship has become more apparent as software companies face renewed selling pressure amid concerns that artificial intelligence could disrupt parts of the industry.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Bitcoin’s recent pullback appears less surprising, as its price has closely tracked the software sector’s movements.\n\nBitcoin’s recent price performance tracks closely with software stocks.

The move marks a potential bullish break of structure (BOS), if BTC holds above $68,000.\n\nIf BTC holds above this reclaimed level, the next internal liquidity zones sit near $71,500 and $74,000. The 50- and 100-period exponential moving averages (EMAs) are now compressing beneath the price on the one-hour chart, reinforcing the possibility of the short-term momentum continuing.\n\nThe latest price surge triggered about $96 million in futures liquidations over the past four hours, with nearly $92 million coming from short positions, signaling a short squeeze on bearish traders.\n\nBTC liquidations were primarily concentrated on Bybit (22.5%), Hyperliquid (22%) and Gate (15%), suggesting these platforms account for a significant share of active leveraged positioning in the market.\n\nRelated: Multi-day negative Bitcoin funding signals ‘overcrowded’ short trade: Reversal coming?\n\nBTC retail investor demand backs the breakout\n\nThe breakout is supported by the steady buying from the smaller-sized investors.
