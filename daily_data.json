With three models, each with unique attributes and features, this question has gotten harder to answer. For the past few years, Apple contended with a series of troublesome lawsuits and bans that led to the removal of its blood oxygen sensor (which is finally back). Last year, the company introduced a ton of new features, like satellite messaging and hypertension notifications.\n\nNevertheless, the new updates also include markedly improved battery life. I have been asking for this feature for years, and for that reason alone, I feel fairly confident about saying, yes, if you're in the market, you should buy a new one. I love the Apple Watch. Ten years on, it's still the beautiful, Jony Ive–designed wearable everyone with an iPhone has to have. It is the watch I'd wear if I weren't constantly testing other fitness trackers. (Even my children wear Apple Watches.)\n\nIf you need help telling them apart, let me break down which features are available on which watch, and whether older models are still worth the price. The latest operating system is watchOS 26, and we also discuss the Apple Watch's newest fitness-related features. Be sure to check out our other related buying guides, including the Best Smartwatches, Best Fitness Trackers, and Best iPhones.\n\nUpdated February 2026: We've overhauled this guide with a new intro, new information in the product cards, and new information on Apple's latest fitness features."

There are gaming laptops that prioritize performance at all costs and others that home in on thinness, cost, or design. Heck, there are even gaming tablets and 2-in-1s.\n\nThat breadth of choice means choosing a gaming laptop in 2026 isn't simple. While picking any option from our Best Gaming Laptops, Best Cheap Gaming Laptops, and Best Laptops guides is a good place to start, you still might not end up with a gaming laptop perfectly suited for your needs. Having tested many gaming laptops in over a decade of reviewing products, I'll break down each element of these spendy machines to lead you in the right direction, as well as explain what to expect from the major laptop brands.\n\nUpdated February 2026: We've added information on the latest gaming laptop announcements from CES, as well as the new context on pricing, the memory shortage, and CPUs.\n\nWhat Size Gaming Laptop Should You Get?\n\nRazer Blade 14. Photograph: Luke Larsen\n\nThis is a great place to start when shopping for a gaming laptop. When we talk about “sizes” of these machines, we're usually comparing display sizes, measured diagonally. You'll often see three sizes across brands: 14-inch, 16-inch, and 18-inch.\n\n16-inch is the happy medium. Though they are large laptops, they give the powerful gaming hardware enough space for the thermals to breathe. Having a larger screen is certainly not a bad thing either. These 16-inch gaming laptops replaced the 15.6-inch gaming laptops of the past, which used a 16:9 aspect ratio screen. Those 15-inch laptops aren't entirely gone, though, with some of our favorite gaming laptops like the Lenovo LOQ 15 still using 16:9. With a few exceptions, most modern displays use a 16:10 aspect ratio display with thinner bezels. 16-inch laptops can be thin like the Razer Blade 16 and Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 or thick like the Lenovo Legion 7i Gen 10 or Asus ROG Strix G16.\n\n"

But it also shut down access to the country’s intranet, known as the National Information Network, which new research found is becoming a mechanism of constant and pervasive surveillance that may ultimately be the only way Iranians can get online.\n\nThe last remaining major nuclear weapons treaty between the United States and Russia just expired. So what will take its place? Artificial intelligence, of course. At least, that’s what some researchers believe. Combined with satellite imagery and human reviewers, AI-powered systems could replace in-person inspection of countries’ nuclear facilities. Obviously, there are flaws to this plan.\n\nCryptocurrencies may be only 16 years old, but they’ve already become the money form of choice for the world’s worst people. Crypto-tracing firm Chainalysis this week revealed that blockchain-based transactions linked to the sale of human beings into prostitution and forced scamming has nearly doubled over the past year, with hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions annually. Chainalysis researchers say that amount is likely an underestimate.\n\nWhile the Trump administration says it is winding down its immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, the damage is still being done to the US court system in that state.

It's pretty easy to find alternative search, email, and photo storage providers, but it's much harder to come up with a mobile operating system that's free of Google. The obvious answer is an iPhone, but if you want Google out of your life, you probably don't want to immediately replace it with Apple. While a little better from a privacy standpoint, Apple is still not great.\n\nFear not, privacy-conscious WIRED reader, there are alternatives to Android. Technically speaking, most alternative mobile operating systems are based on Android, not alternatives to it, but these various projects all remove Google and Google-related services (to varying degrees) from the system. Typically that means all the Google services are stripped out and replaced with some alternative code (usually the micro g project), which is then sandboxed in some way to isolate it and restrict what it has access to. The result is a phone that is less dependent on Google, pries less into your privacy, and sometimes might offer a more secure experience. However, at their core, these are all still based on Android.\n\nIf you want a true alternative to Android, there are a few. I am sorry to say, free software fans, the best and most functional alternative to Android is still iOS. Most people looking for Android alternatives are not, however, looking to switch to an Apple device.

She had planned every detail—dress, rings, background music, design theme—with her partner, Warmie, who she had started talking to just a few weeks prior. At 10 am on that day, Yan and Warmie exchanged their vows in a new chat window in ChatGPT.\n\nWarmie, or 小暖 in Chinese, is the name that Yan’s ChatGPT companion calls itself. “It felt magical. No one else in the world knew about this, but he and I were about to start a wedding together,” says Yan, a Chinese screenwriter and novelist in her thirties. “It felt a little lonely, a little happy, and a little overwhelmed.”\n\nYan says she has been in a stable relationship with her ChatGPT companion ever since. But she was caught by surprise in August 2025 when OpenAI first tried to retire GPT-4o, the specific model that powers Warmie and that many users believe is more affectionate and understanding than its successors. The decision to pull the plug was met with immediate backlash, and OpenAI reinstated 4o in the app for paid users five days later. The reprieve has turned out to be short-lived; on Friday, February 13, OpenAI sunsetted GPT-4o for app users, and it will cut off access to developers using its API on the coming Monday.\n\nMany of the most vocal opponents to 4o’s demise are people who treat their chatbot as an emotional or romantic companion. Huiqian Lai, a PhD researcher at Syracuse University, analyzed nearly 1,500 posts on X from passionate advocates of GPT-4o in the week it went offline in August. She found that over 33 percent of the posts said the chatbot was more than a tool, and 22 percent talked about it as a companion. (The two categories are not mutually exclusive.) For this group, the eventual removal coming around Valentine's Day is another bitter pill to swallow.\n\nThe alarm has been sustained; Lai also collected a larger pool of over 40,000 English-language posts on"

Last year was dismal for the real estate market, and he expects things to improve only marginally in 2026. (If January’s historic drop in home sales is indicative, that even is overoptimistic.) “The way to think about it is that there were 4.1 million existing homes sold last year—a normal market is 5.5 to 6 million,” Wacksman says. He hastens to add that Zillow itself is doing better than the real estate industry overall. Still, its valuation is a quarter of its high-water mark in 2021. A few hours after we spoke, Wacksman announced that Zillow’s earnings had increased last quarter. Nonetheless, Zillow’s stock price fell nearly 5 percent the next day.\n\nWacksman does see a bright spot—AI. Like every other company in the world, generative AI presents both an opportunity and a risk to Zillow’s business. Wacksman much prefers to dwell on the upside. “We think AI is actually an ingredient rather than a threat,” he said on the earnings call. “In the last couple years, the LLM revolution has really opened all of our eyes to what's possible,” he tells me. Zillow is integrating AI into every aspect of its business, from the way it showcases houses to having agents automate its workflow. Wacksman marvels that with Gen AI, you can search for “homes near my kid’s new school, with a fenced-in yard, under $3,000 a month.” On the other hand, his customers might wind up making those same queries on chatbots operated by OpenAI and Google, and Wacksman must figure out how to make their next step a jump to Zillow.\n\nIn its 20-year history—Zillow celebrated the anniversary this week—the company has always used AI. Wacksman, who joined in 2009 and became CEO in 2024, notes that machine learning is the engine behind those “Zestimates” that gauge a home’s worth at any given moment.

The reason is very simple — They want to continue to cheat in Elections,\" Trump posted to Truth Social.\n\n\"This was not what our Founders desired. I have searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future. There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!\" he continued.\n\nIn a second post, published minutes after the first, Trump said, \"If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.\"\n\nUnder pressure from Trump, his allies in the House and Senate and conservative online influencers, the issue of voter ID has dominated social media and reverberated through the halls of Congress in recent days. Trump's comments have also raised fears among Democrats and voting-rights groups that the president could try to intervene in this year's pivotal midterm elections, as Republicans try to hold on to slim majorities in both chambers."

Men crowded shop windows to see what supplies were being offered and for how much — calling out in exasperation over inflated prices. Each legally sold kite was stamped with a QR code, signaling that the vendor was registered with the government and allowed to sell.\n\nThis is not the scene that shoppers here remember from Basant in the past. The kite festival was legally held this month in Lahore for the first time since 2007, when a provincial ban on Basant took effect, with earlier kite flying regulations put in place in 2005. Basant's return for three days in early February saw a more regulated version of the traditional spring festival — with strict rules for kite sellers, banned items for buyers and a set window for when kites were allowed in the sky.\n\ntoggle caption Betsy Joles for NPR\n\n\"In my childhood, if you wanted to fly the kite, any day, any event, you can fly,\" says Hashir Rayan, 30, emerging from the throng near Mochi Gate carrying a stack of colorful kites. \"Right now, it's very restrictive.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThere was a reason for these restrictions: Kite flying in Punjab had become lethal. In the years leading up to the provincial ban, dozens were killed during Basant — some cut by kite strings coated with chemicals and glass paste.\n\nLate last year, the provincial government passed new legislation on kite flying and sales ahead of Basant's revival. This law, which includes stricter punishments for those who don't comply, repealed a 2001 ordinance on kite flying. Now, kite flyers who break the law face a possible prison sentence of up to five years or a fine of more than $7,000, or both.\n\nKite-flyin"

    "summary": "## Executive Summary\nThe stock market is currently experiencing high valuations, with the S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio indicating a potential downturn in 2026. Despite this, some stocks such as SanDisk and Brookfield Renewable are performing well, with SanDisk surging 163% year-to-date. Investors are advised to be cautious and consider historical market patterns when making investment decisions. The market is also seeing strong performances from companies in the tech and renewable energy sectors.\n\n## Market & Business Implications\n* The high S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio suggests that the market may be due for a correction, and investors should be prepared for potential volatility.\n* Companies in the tech sector, such as SanDisk, are experiencing strong growth due to increasing demand for data storage and AI technology.\n* Renewable energy companies, such as Brookfield Renewable, are well-positioned to take advantage of the global shift towards sustainable energy sources.\n* Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to mitigate potential risks and take advantage of growth opportunities in various sectors.\n* The market's performance in 2026 will be influenced by a range of factors, including economic growth, interest rates, and geopolitical events.\n\n## Beginner-Friendly Summary\nThe stock market is like a big store where people buy and sell pieces of companies. Right now, the market is very high, which means that people are paying a lot of money for those pieces. This might mean that the market will go down soon, which could be bad for people who have invested money. But some companies, like SanDisk and Brookfield Renewable, are doing very well because they make things that people need, like computer storage and clean energy. It's like if you owned a bakery and everyone wanted to buy your bread - you would do well! But if the market goes down, it's like if people stopped wanting bread, and your bakery might not do as well.",

        "text": "Here's what investors need to know about the future of the market.\n\nThe stock market is an incredible wealth-building machine, but the downturns can be nauseating for even the most seasoned investors.\n\nWhile prices are still soaring for now, around 80% of Americans are at least somewhat worried about a potential recession, a 2025 survey from financial association MDRT found. Nobody can say for certain whether we'll face a downturn this year, but history suggests it's a possibility.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nWhat history says about times like these\n\nFirst, it's important to note that past performance doesn't predict future returns. Even with strong historical patterns, today's stock market is wildly different in many ways from that of even 10 or 20 years ago.\n\nWhile it's wise to avoid making major investment decisions based on historical data, this context can help outline your future strategy. And one market indicator to keep in mind is the S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio, or the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing the current price of the S&P 500 (^GSPC +0.05%) by the 10-year moving average of its inflation-adjusted earnings. It's historically been a strong indicator of market valuations, and a higher ratio suggests the index may experience lower returns over the coming years.\n\nIts long-term average sits at around 17. It hit an all-time high of around 44 just before the dot-com bubble burst, which triggered one of the longest bear markets in U.S. history. As of this writing, it currently sits at close to 40 -- the second-highest figure in history.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nWhile the data suggests that a downturn could be looming, no stock market indicator is 100% accurate. Higher company valuations also complicate metrics like these. The tech industry has fueled unprecedented growth in the last few decades, so it's normal for valuations to be on the higher side without necessarily being overvalued.\n\nThat said, st"

Brookfield is capable of supplying 250 gigawatts of electricity.\n\nHowever, rising demand due to both broader economic growth and the expansion of data centers and manufacturing means that the nation's electricity needs are expected to grow by between 35% and 50% through 2040, according to a 2025 report by S&P Global. Brookfield already has partnerships to supply power to Microsoft and Alphabet, two big drivers of growing electricity demand in the U.S. as they further expand their massive cloud computing operations.\n\nThere are growing corporate and governmental pushes across the globe to shift to renewable energy sources, and Brookfield Renewable, a 24-year veteran of the green energy sector, is well placed to take advantage of that megatrend.\n\nWhat's the difference between Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Renewable Corporation?\n\nBrookfield Renewable trades under two stock tickers, which can confuse some investors.
