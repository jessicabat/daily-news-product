        "text": "For years now, when we think of mobile gaming, we think of app stores. Developers invest countless hours, months, or even years creating games just to surrender a significant portion—up to 30%—of their earnings to major players like Apple and Google. However, a newcomer has entered the scene, aiming to revolutionize this model.\n\nMeet Jest, a marketplace for messaging games that recently emerged from stealth with $7 million in seed funding. Jest believes that the future of gaming won’t come from an app store, but rather from right within your messaging app.\n\nJest’s launch coincides with the rise of Rich Communication Services (RCS), an enhanced version of SMS that enables more engaging experiences through rich media, interactive features, and embedded payments. With RCS making significant advancements, the landscape is shifting dramatically. In 2024, Apple joined the RCS movement with iOS 18, and by May 2025, RCS was supporting over a billion messages daily in the U.S., according to Google.\n\n“Mobile game developers have largely been locked into app store distribution as the primary way to reach players,” Deyan Vitanov, CEO and co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “RCS games live in the messaging inbox, the stickiest surface on mobile, where people are already spending huge amounts of time talking to friends and family. We’re building on an interaction pattern people already use every day.”\n\nImage Credits:Jest\n\nJest offers users the ability to send games directly in their chat threads, without having to visit an app store. (Games launch in the web browser and require Wi-Fi to play.) This convenience is particularly impactful as consumers are downloading fewer games. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, reflecting an 8.6% year-over-year decline following a 6.6% drop from 2023 to 2024, according to Appfigures’ annual report.\n\nJest’s strategy is proving effective. By the end of January, just four months into its beta phase, the platform "

The voice-enabled chatbot, called “Patty,” is part of an overarching BK Assistant platform that will not only assist employees with meal preparation but also evaluate their interactions with customers for “friendliness.”\n\nThibault Roux, Burger King’s chief digital officer, tells The Verge that the company compiled information from franchisees and guests on how to measure friendliness, resulting in the fast food chain training its AI system to recognize certain words and phrases, such as “welcome to Burger King,” “please,” and “thank you.” Managers can then ask the AI assistant how their location is performing on friendliness. “This is all meant to be a coaching tool,” Roux says, adding that the company is “iterating” on capturing the tone of conversations as well.\n\nThe OpenAI-powered Patty serves as the “voice” of the BK Assistant platform, which combines data across drive-thru conversations, kitchen equipment, inventory, and other areas of the Burger King business. Employees can ask Patty questions, such as how many strips of bacon to put on a Maple Bourbon BBQ Whopper, or for instructions on how to clean the shake machine.\n\nBecause it’s integrated with the new cloud point-of-sale system, the AI assistant will also alert managers if a machine is down for maintenance or when an item is out of stock. “Within 15 minutes, the entire ecosystem will remove it from stock — whether you’re walking into a restaurant to order from the kiosk, whether you’re going to the drive-thru, the digital menu board will be updated,” Roux says.\n\nBurger King may be building a chatbot into employees’ headsets, but it doesn’t seem like the brand is ready to widely launch"

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei an ultimatum on Tuesday to roll back the company’s AI safeguards or risk losing a $200 million Pentagon contract. The Pentagon threatened to put Anthropic on what is effectively a government blacklist.\n\nBut the company said in its blog post that its previous safety policy was designed to build industry consensus around mitigating AI risks – guardrails that the industry blew through. Anthropic also noted its safety policy was out of step with Washington’s current anti-regulatory political climate.\n\nAnthropic’s previous policy stipulated that it should pause training more powerful models if their capabilities outstripped the company’s ability to control them and ensure their safety — a measure that’s been removed in the new policy. Anthropic argued that responsible AI developers pausing growth while less careful actors plowed ahead could “result in a world that is less safe.”\n\nAs part of the new policy, Anthropic said it will separate its own safety plans from its recommendations for the AI industry.\n\nAnthropic wrote that it had hoped its original safety princip"

        "text": "Over the past 15 years, password managers have grown from a niche security tool used by the technology savvy into an indispensable security tool for the masses, with an estimated 94 million US adults—or roughly 36 percent of them—having adopted them. They store not only passwords for pension, financial, and email accounts, but also cryptocurrency credentials, payment card numbers, and other sensitive data.\n\nAll eight of the top password managers have adopted the term “zero knowledge” to describe the complex encryption system they use to protect the data vaults that users store on their servers. The definitions vary slightly from vendor to vendor, but they generally boil down to one bold assurance: that there is no way for malicious insiders or hackers who manage to compromise the cloud infrastructure to steal vaults or data stored in them. These promises make sense, given previous breaches of LastPass and the reasonable expectation that state-level hackers have both the motive and capability to obtain password vaults belonging to high-value targets.\n\nA bold assurance debunked\n\nTypical of these claims are those made by Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass, which together are used by roughly 60 million people. Bitwarden, for example, says that “not even the team at Bitwarden can read your data (even if we wanted to).” Dashlane, meanwhile, says that without a user’s master password, “malicious actors can’t steal the information, even if Dashlane’s servers are compromised.” LastPass says that no one can access the “data stored in your LastPass vault, except you (not even LastPass).”\n\nNew research shows that these claims aren’t true in all cases, particularly when account recovery is in place or password managers are set to share vaults or organize users into groups. The researchers reverse-engineered or closely analyzed Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass and identified ways that someone with control over the server—either administrative or the result of a compromise—can, in"

The large language model suggested “a two-in-one punishment,” she says—write 100 lines of “I will remember to kneel for my Dom every night” while kneeling the entire time.\n\nThough the couple started exploring kink in their marriage 15 years ago—they are in a dominant-submissive relationship—the AI-generated punishment was new territory for them.\n\nSince then, Madison, who is 44 and lives in Los Angeles, says she has come to think of AI as “a powerful enhancement tool” for kink. “A lot of the times in dom-sub dynamics, when the submissive misbehaves—if it’s consented to—you will have a punishment. You want something specific to fit the crime, basically. It’s like a fresh set of eyes on your relationship.”\n\nAI represents a unique evolution in how power is distributed for people into bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism—BDSM. The lifestyle structure, as everyone WIRED spoke to for this story noted, is grounded in the core tenets of consent, safety, communication, and trust. But for those dealing with trust issues, or who simply want a nonjudgmental space to ask questions about BDSM, AI is becoming an increasingly appealing option.\n\n“I’ve gotten value out of AI helping me understand myself better as a submissive. I sometimes ask it questions or describe something that feels confusing to me and ask it to help me understand,” one user posted in the r/SubSanctuary subreddit, where discussions involve topics like impact play, the feeling of “being owned,” and how to move on when the relationship has reached its end.

However, prices for chicken and beef have increased since Trump took office in January 2025. Egg prices have indeed fallen significantly — but, like beef prices, have been influenced more by supply-and-demand factors specific to those markets than federal policy, according to agricultural economists. The price moves also come as the Trump administration said it was \"ending the war on protein\" by announcing new U.S. nutrition guidelines that emphasize protein, full-fat dairy and vegetables. \"President Trump is right: inflation has cooled, and prices of many everyday essentials have fallen or are on the right trajectory,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in an emailed statement. \"The entire Administration remains laser-focused on delivering economic relief for the American people.\"\n\nBeef prices have increased during Trump's second term\n\nTrump said during his State of the Union address that beef prices are \"starting to come down significantly.\" Federal data shows that beef prices have started to decline in some cases, but remain near multi-year or record highs.

The development comes after President Trump claimed, without providing evidence, in his State of the Union address that Iran was developing missiles that could reach the U.S. The U.S. military buildup in the Middle East is currently at its highest level since the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003.\n\ntoggle caption Costas Metaxakis/AFP via Getty Images\n\n🎧 The U.S.' threats against Iran and the possibility of Iranian retaliation have raised the risk of a wider war, putting the entire region on high alert, NPR's Jane Arraf tells Up First. Ahead of the two countries' meeting, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that there is a basis for an agreement with the U.S. on the nuclear issue, but made it clear that ballistic missiles are off the table. Arraf says no breakthroughs are expected today; however, scheduling more talks would signal progress. Meanwhile, several countries in the Middle East, such as Lebanon, are advising citizens to leave while they still can because of the risk of the conflict widening if Iran is attacked.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nProminent Harvard professor and economist Larry Summers announced his resignation from teaching later this year. His statement comes after a new revelation about Summers' relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Summers is one of Harvard's most well-known figures, serving as its president for five years starting in 2001. He was also Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton.

Recipients aren’t supposed to owe any taxes until the money is withdrawn, which can happen at any point after a child turns 18, in accordance with rules for traditional IRAs.\n\nBut despite a flashy rollout that included a Super Bowl ad this month, many U.S. states don’t recognize Trump accounts, which means the money isn’t shielded from taxes.\n\nThat’s not in issue in D.C. and the 20 states that automatically match federal tax law or in the nine states that don’t impose a personal income tax. The Washington Post asked the remaining 21 states whether earnings in Trump accounts would be taxed.\n\nSeven said the annual earnings, under existing laws, would be considered taxable: California, Hawaii, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Wisconsin. Georgia, Maine, Vermont and Indiana said state legislation is under consideration to exempt the accounts from annual state taxes. Minnesota, Mississippi and North Carolina said the issue would be decided later.\n\nVirginia and Idaho said the accounts would not be taxed annually.\n\nFive states did not respond to The Post’s query.\n\nSince the investment accounts will belong to minors, many participants will fall below the threshold that requires paying yearly taxes.

    "summary": "## Executive Summary\nIDEX's stock price has climbed to $206.19 per share, with a 24.2% return over the past six months, outpacing the S&P 500. Rolls-Royce has raised its outlook, expecting profits of over £4 billion this year, and plans a share buyback of up to $12 billion. Stellantis, the Jeep maker, has reported its first annual loss in company history due to substantial write-downs amid a strategic shift. The stock market is seeing mixed reactions, with some stocks rising and others stalling.\n\n## Market & Business Implications\n* IDEX's core business is falling behind as demand plateaus, with no growth in organic revenue over the last two years, as stated in Article 1.\n* Rolls-Royce expects underlying operating profit of between £4 billion and £4.2 billion in 2026, and plans to complete £2.5 billion of share buybacks this year, as reported in Article 2.\n* Stellantis has posted a full-year 2025 net loss of 22.3 billion euros, impacted by 25.4 billion euros in write-downs, as the firm sharply scales back its electric vehicle strategy, according to Article 4.\n\n## Beginner-Friendly Summary\nSome big companies are having different experiences. IDEX's stock is doing well, but the company itself is not growing as fast as it could be. Rolls-Royce is doing very well and plans to buy back some of its own shares. Stellantis, a car company, is having a tough time and lost a lot of money last year. The stock market is a little mixed, with some stocks going up and others not moving much.",

This performance may have investors wondering how to approach the situation.\n\nIs there a buying opportunity in IDEX, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? See what our analysts have to say in our full research report, it’s free.\n\nWhy Do We Think IDEX Will Underperform?\n\nDespite the momentum, we're sitting this one out for now. Here are three reasons we avoid IEX and a stock we'd rather own.\n\n1. Core Business Falling Behind as Demand Plateaus\n\nWe can better understand Gas and Liquid Handling companies by analyzing their organic revenue. This metric gives visibility into IDEX’s core business because it excludes one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures along with foreign currency fluctuations - non-fundamental factors that can manipulate the income statement.\n\nOver the last two years, IDEX failed to grow its organic revenue. This performance was underwhelming and implies it may need to improve its products, pricing, or go-to-market strategy. It also suggests IDEX might have to lean into acquisitions to accelerate growth, which isn’t ideal because M&A can be expensive and risky (integrations often disrupt focus).\n\nIDEX Organic Revenue Growth\n\n2. EPS Took a Dip Over the Last Two Years\n\nWhile long-term earnings trends give us the big picture, we also track EPS over a shorter period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\n\nSadly for IDEX, its EPS declined by 1.7% annually over the last two years while its revenue grew by 2.8%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\n\nIDEX Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\n3. New Investments Fail to Bear Fruit as ROIC Declines\n\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company’s ROIC can also be an early indicator of future business quality.\n\nWe like to invest "

It expects free cash flow of between £3.6 billion and £3.8 billion this year, also above expectations.\n\nIt also announced that £2.5 billion of share buybacks would be completed this year as part of a multi-year buyback program of between £7 billion and £9 billion ($12 billion) for 2026 to 2028, above what earlier media reports had suggested.\n\nShares rose as much as 7% in early trading on Thursday.

Beyond the mid-term, Erginbilgic said he expected his company to benefit from AI, the energy transition, and increased defense spending.\n\nRolls-Royce shares have been on a tear over the past few years amid growth in all three of its businesses: civil aerospace, defense, and power systems. Over the past 12 months, the stock has more than doubled as the company has thrived amid a transformation plan launched by Erginbilgic, which has boosted investor confidence.

Integrated into withdrawal flows, the system allows exchanges to flag or block transfers to addresses believed to be associated with active scams.\n\nTraditional anti-money laundering (AML) tools typically focus on the sender through Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and transaction monitoring. Alterya instead concentrates on the recipient side, identifying wallets and accounts tied to scam networks or money mule operations.\n\nChainalysis acquired Alterya early last year in a deal reportedly valued at $150 million, marking its expansion beyond blockchain tracing into real-time fraud prevention for payments.\n\nPrior to the acquisition, Alterya worked with exchanges including Coinbase and Binance.
